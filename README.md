# LWM's DeepStorage - a mod for RimWorld

## This is a **work-in-progress** version of Deep Storage Units

LWM presents another way to deal with your storage needs:  Deep Storage units!

Currently available are multiple buildings that can store more than one object at a time.  Inspired by Skullywag's Extended Storage, this mod takes a different approach - storage buildings that pawns can simply carry multiple items to.  An approach that got a lot harder with 1.0, BTW, but I like the results so far.

Pallets, clothing racks, food storage trays, etc.  You can also write your own <ThingDef>s if you don't like what I've done.

This mod will be updating as I tweak items and fix bugs, but I wanted to make it available now that it's mostly working.

## Installation
 * Put the LWM.DeepStorage folder (under _Mod) inside your game's Mod/ folder.  Update often?

## Mod Compatibility
 * RimWorld Search Agency: Load AFTER RSA, please.  Disables Hauling Hysteresis for DSUs - not perfect but very useable!

## Known Bugs
 * If you save a game after destroying/moving a Deep Storage unit, things are likely to break.

## Planned/Likely Changes
 * Stop using Harmony directly and use HugsLib?
 * Make it easier to select DSUs when they are under 5 layers of clothing...add Gizmo?
 * Possibly limit by mass.
 * Possibly limit by total mass.
 * Possible options

## Update:
 * To quickly select a Deep Storage Unit under a pile of things:  Select one of the items in the unit, and then right click!
 * Now using Ratysz' fix allowing right-clicking on a large pile of weapons/clothing to give menu options for each one.  (thanks, and GPL for the win).
 * Added preliminary Weapon Locker - subject to change!  But you can put some weapons away now, at least ;)  (working with Sumghai)
