<!-- Compatibility for CombatExtended, specifications from sumghai,
     who actually plays it, and has a vision for how it should work.
     No one else has made any requests, so he gets pretty much 
     exactly what he wants ^.^ -->
<!-- Note that the Cabinet and Locker, despite different requirements,
     have the same storage capacity; this may change in the future, but
     if so, not by much-->
