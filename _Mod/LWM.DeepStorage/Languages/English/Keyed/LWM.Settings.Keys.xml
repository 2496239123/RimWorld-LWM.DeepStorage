  <LWMDSstoringTakesTimeLabel>If you really want to turn off the delay while storing, uncheck this.</LWMDSstoringTakesTimeLabel>
  <LWMDSstoringTakesTimeDesc>Turning this off is not how LWM plays.  But hey, it's your game!  You do you!</LWMDSstoringTakesTimeDesc>
  <LWMDSstoringGlobalScale>Global Storing Time:  {0}%\nIf you want to adjust how long it takes pawns to store items (maybe you think it takes too long), you can adjust this setting, and it will apply to all storage units.</LWMDSstoringGlobalScale>
  <LWMDSstoringTimeConsidersStackSize>Does storing time consider stack size?</LWMDSstoringTimeConsidersStackSize>
  <LWMDSstoringTimeConsidersStackSizeDesc>If selected (default), storing 75 of something may take longer than storing 3.  This mainly affects Skips.  You probably want to turn this off if you are using a mod that makes stack sizes really big.</LWMDSstoringTimeConsidersStackSizeDesc>

  <LWM_DS_Storage_ArchitectMenuAlwaysShowCategory>Always show the Storage category?</LWM_DS_Storage_ArchitectMenuAlwaysShowCategory>
  <LWM_DS_Storage_ArchitectMenuAlwaysShowDesc>The default place for all Deep Storage units is in the "Storage" category in the Architect Menu.  If you change it, by default, the Storage category goes away.  Check this if you want it to always be there, even if there are no Deep Storage units in it.</LWM_DS_Storage_ArchitectMenuAlwaysShowDesc>
  <LWM_DS_Storage_ArchitectMenuMoveALL>Put (almost) ALL storage units here?</LWM_DS_Storage_ArchitectMenuMoveALL>
  <LWM_DS_Storage_ArchitectMenuMoveALLDesc>Check this to move things like vanilla shelves or other mods' storage units to "Storage" too.  "Production" storage buildings (like Hoppers) are not moved.  REQUIRES RESTART TO FULLY TURN OFF!  If you uncheck this, items will end up in "Furniture" until you restart.</LWM_DS_Storage_ArchitectMenuMoveALLDesc>

  <LWM_DS_IntTitle>Intelligence Required to Haul to Deep Storage</LWM_DS_IntTitle>
  <LWM_DS_IntDesc>This option can let your animals/robots/whatever haul TO Deep Storage.\nMost alien races have "Humanlike" or better.  Most animals are "animal."  Vanilla Mechanoids are "tool users"  Robots for various mods?  Your guess is as good as mine.\nNote that ANYONE may take FROM Deep Storage.</LWM_DS_IntDesc>
