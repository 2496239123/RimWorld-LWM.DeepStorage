  <LWMDSstoringGlobalScale>Global Storing Time:  {0}%\nIf you want to adjust how long it takes pawns to store items (maybe you think it takes too long), you can adjust this setting, and it will apply to all storage units.</LWMDSstoringGlobalScale>

  <LWM_DS_IntTitle>Intelligence Required to Haul to Deep Storage</LWM_DS_IntTitle>
  <LWM_DS_IntDesc>This option can let your animals/robots/whatever haul TO Deep Storage.\nMost alien races have "Humanlike" or better.  Most animals are "animal."  Vanilla Mechanoids are "tool users"  Robots for various mods?  Your guess is as good as mine.\nNote that ANYONE may take FROM Deep Storage.</LWM_DS_IntDesc>

  <!-- Stat text -->
  <LWM_DS_maxNumStacks>maximum number of stacks</LWM_DS_maxNumStacks>
  <LWM_DS_maxNumStacksDesc>The maximum number of stacks that can go in a single space.  Buildings two-cells large will have twice as much storage capacity.  Note that other factors may reduce storage capacity</LWM_DS_maxNumStacksDesc>
  <LWM_DS_maxTotalMass>maximum total mass</LWM_DS_maxTotalMass>
  <LWM_DS_maxTotalMassDesc>The maximum mass that the storage unit can hold.  Once the unit is full, no more items can be added (altho most units can always store a minimum of at least two items.)  Note that if the building is more than one cell large, this limit is divided evenly among all the cells.</LWM_DS_maxTotalMassDesc>
  <LWM_DS_maxMassOfStoredItem>maximum mass of any stored item</LWM_DS_maxMassOfStoredItem>
  <LWM_DS_maxMassOfStoredItemDesc>The maximum mass of any given item that can be stored in this unit.  Vanilla RimWorld doesn't have any stat for "size" so mass is used.  If you are using the Combat Extended mod, they have a "Bulk" stat that is used instead.\nThe basic idea is the same: some items are too big to easily fit here.</LWM_DS_maxMassOfStoredItemDesc>
