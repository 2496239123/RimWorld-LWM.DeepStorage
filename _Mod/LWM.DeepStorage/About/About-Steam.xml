[h1]This is a [b]work-in-progress[/b] version of Deep Storage Units[/h1]

LWM presents another way to deal with your storage needs:  Deep Storage units!

Currently available are multiple buildings that can store more than one object at a time.  Inspired by Skullywag's Extended Storage, this mod takes a different approach - storage buildings that pawns can simply carry multiple items to.  An approach that got a lot harder with 1.0, BTW, but I like the results so far.

Pallets, clothing racks, food storage trays, etc.  You can also write your own &lt;ThingDef&gt;xs if you don't like what I've done.

This mod will be updating as I tweak items and fix bugs, but I wanted to make it available now that it's mostly working.

[u]Known Bugs[/u]
[list]
 [*] If you save a game after destroying/moving a Deep Storage unit, things are likely to break.
[/list]
[u]Planned/Likely Changes[/u]
[list]
 [*] Stop using Harmony directly and use HugsLib?
 [*] Make it easier to select DSUs when they are under 5 layers of clothing...add Gizmo?
 [*] Possibly limit by mass.
 [*] Possibly limit by total mass.
 [*] Possible options
[/list]

[h1]Update:[/h1]
 [*] To quickly select a Deep Storage Unit under a pile of things:  Select one of the items in the unit, and then right click!
 [*] Now using Ratysz' fix allowing right-clicking on a large pile of weapons/clothing to give menu options for each one.  (thanks, and GPL for the win).
 [*] Added preliminary Weapon Locker - subject to change!  But you can put some weapons away now, at least ;)  (working with Sumghai)
