&lt;size=24&gt;This is a &lt;b&gt;work-in-progress&lt;/b&gt; version of Deep Storage Units&lt;/size&gt;

LWM presents another way to deal with your storage needs:  Deep Storage units!

Currently available are multiple buildings that can store more than one object at a time.  Inspired by Skullywag's Extended Storage, this mod takes a different approach - storage buildings that pawns can simply carry multiple items to.  An approach that got a lot harder with 1.0, BTW, but I like the results so far.

Pallets, clothing racks, food storage trays, etc.  You can also write your own &lt;ThingDef&gt;s if you don't like what I've done.

This mod will be updating as I tweak items and fix bugs, but I wanted to make it available now that it's mostly working.

&lt;b&gt;Known Bugs&lt;/b&gt;
 * If you save a game after destroying/moving a Deep Storage unit, things are likely to break.
 * Pawns cannot use many types of items (e.g., put on clothes) from deep inside a DSU.  For whatever reason, consuming food is fine.

&lt;b&gt;Planned/Likely Changes&lt;/b&gt;
 * Stop using Harmony directly and use HugsLib?
 * Make it easier to select DSUs when they are under 5 layers of clothing
 * Possible options
